### 🔒 Encryption Tool in C (Educational)

This project is a simple **encryption tool** written in **C**. It demonstrates how basic message encryption works using simple character shifting (e.g., Caesar cipher logic). The tool allows users to input a message, applies encryption, and displays the encrypted result.

> 🧠 This project is built for **educational purposes** and helps learners understand the basics of data encryption, ASCII manipulation, and string handling in C.

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypts plain text messages using a simple logic
- Supports letters, numbers, and symbols
- Interactive command-line input/output
- Lightweight and mobile-friendly (Cxxdroid-compatible)

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Run the program.
2. Enter a message you want to encrypt.
3. The program shifts characters using a basic algorithm.
4. View the encrypted result immediately in the terminal.

## 📥 Sample Output
`plaintext
Enter your message: Hello123
Enter shift key (e.g., 3): 
Encrypted message: Khoor456
